    <h2>Chapter 52 - Superior</h2>
    <p>"Yes, I just received a visit from the Immigration Bureau yesterday. Is it okay?" Zhou Jing asked.</p>
    <p>Feng Feng (According to MTL) smiled and said, "According to the relevant laws and regulations, if you register as a power user, you and your relatives will be exempted from forced immigration. When the registration here is completed, your status in the system will be changed from an ordinary citizen to a power user citizen. The files at the immigration office will be updated synchronously, and you can freely choose whether to immigrate or not."</p>
    <p>"That's good."</p>
    <p>After confirming with the official, Zhou Jing felt relieved.</p>
    <p>Feng Feng put on a kind smile and continued,</p>
    <p>"You don't have to worry. If you don't want to immigrate, we will help you solve the problem. All the previous compulsory immigration procedures can be abolished. If you want to continue immigrating, you don't need to contact the Immigration Bureau, but just contact me directly."</p>
    <p>"Isn't it under the control of the Immigration Bureau?" Zhou Jing raised his eyebrows.</p>
    <p>"Hehe, our authority is above the Immigration Bureau, you don't need to care about them, they are not qualified to handle your files."</p>
    <p>Feng Feng smiled reservedly, but his tone contained a sense of superiority of a higher-level institution within the system.</p>
    <p>Each official agency has different functions, and the Super Energy Bureau has a higher level than most agencies. As long as it involves power users, they are all managed by them, and other agencies are obliged to provide cooperation.</p>
    <p>As long as you are registered as a power user, if other departments want to process files, they must obtain the consent of the Super Power Bureau. They are no longer called to and fro by various agencies like ordinary people. This is the treatment of power users, to a certain extent. Similar to some secrecy departments.</p>
    <p>In this case, the Super Energy Bureau is a super-giant department, qualified to look down on the vast majority of official institutions...</p>
